This code let's you create pages of a book procedurally by accessing a folder with all the page images/textures in your computer (you have to change this in your code depending on where the images are).

This is an alpha version which I want to develop into a free Blender addon. Use it at your own discretion as it may not work exactly as you expect it to (especially the animation generation).
